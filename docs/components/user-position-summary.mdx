function MyComponent() {
  // Create an Ethereum provider
  const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  
  return (
    <UserPositionSummary 
      provider={provider}
      chainId={1} // Ethereum Mainnet
      userAddress="0x..." // The address to display the position for
    />
  );
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |

## Example

```jsx

  provider={provider}
  chainId={1}
  userAddress="0x..."
  baseAssetSymbol="USDC"
  baseAssetDecimals={6}
  className="max-w-lg mx-auto"
  onRefresh={() => console.log('Position refreshed')}
/>
```

## Displayed Information

The component displays the following information about the user's position:

- **Total Supplied**: The total value of all supplied assets
- **Total Borrowed**: The total amount borrowed
- **Available to Borrow**: The remaining amount available to borrow
- **Health Factor**: A measure of the position's safety (higher is better)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: The point at which the position becomes eligible for liquidation
- **Supplied Assets**: A breakdown of all supplied assets with their values
- **Collateral Assets**: A breakdown of assets being used as collateral

## Health Factor Indicator

The component includes a visual health factor indicator that changes color based on the position's risk level:

- **Green**: Safe position (health factor > 1.5)
- **Yellow**: Moderate risk (health factor between 1.1 and 1.5)
- **Orange**: High risk (health factor between 1.0 and 1.1)
- **Red**: Danger of liquidation (health factor < 1.0)

## Loading and Error States

The component handles loading and error states automatically:

- While data is being fetched, a loading indicator is displayed
- If an error occurs during data fetching, an error message is displayed
- If the user has no position, an appropriate message is shown

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the component using the `className` prop:

```jsx
<UserPositionSummary 
  provider={provider}
  chainId={1}
  userAddress="0x..."
  className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800"
/>
```
