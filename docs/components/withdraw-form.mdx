## Features

The `WithdrawForm` component includes the following features:

- **Asset Selection**: Users can select which asset they want to withdraw
- **Amount Input**: Users can enter the amount they want to withdraw
- **Balance Display**: Shows the user's current supplied balance of the selected asset
- **Max Button**: Allows users to quickly set the maximum amount they can withdraw
- **Validation**: Validates input to ensure it's within allowed limits and won't put the account at risk

  chainId={1}
  className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800"
