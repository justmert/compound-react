The Compound React library includes a set of ready-to-use UI components built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) that make it easy to create beautiful and functional interfaces for interacting with the Compound III protocol.

These components are designed to work seamlessly with the hooks provided by the library, handling loading states, error handling, and data formatting for you.

## Available Components

The library includes the following UI components:

- [Asset Info Card](/components/asset-info-card) - Displays detailed information about a collateral asset
- [Interest Rate Display](/components/interest-rate-display) - Shows current supply and borrow interest rates
- [Market Stats](/components/market-stats) - Displays market statistics like total supply, borrow, and utilization
- [User Position Summary](/components/user-position-summary) - Shows a user's position including health factor
- [Transaction History](/components/transaction-history) - Displays a history of user transactions
- [Supply Form](/components/supply-form) - Form for supplying assets to the protocol
- [Withdraw Form](/components/withdraw-form) - Form for withdrawing assets from the protocol
- [Asset Selector](/components/asset-selector) - For selecting assets from the protocol
- [Network Selector](/components/network-selector) - For selecting supported networks
- [Compound Dashboard](/components/compound-dashboard) - A comprehensive dashboard combining multiple components

## Getting Started

To use these components in your application, simply import them from the library:

```jsx
import { 
  CompoundProvider, 
  AssetInfoCard, 
  UserPositionSummary 
} from 'compound-react';
import { providers } from 'ethers';

function App() {
  // Create an Ethereum provider
  const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  
  return (
    <CompoundProvider provider={provider} chainId={1}>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
        <UserPositionSummary 
          userAddress="0x..." 
          baseAssetSymbol="USDC" 
        />
        <AssetInfoCard assetIndex={0} />
      </div>
    </CompoundProvider>
  );
}
```

## Styling

The components use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and are built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), making them highly customizable. You can override the default styles by passing className props to the components.

For more information on customizing the components, see the [Styling Guide](/components/styling).
