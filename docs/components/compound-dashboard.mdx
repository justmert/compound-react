The `CompoundDashboard` component provides a complete user interface for interacting with the Compound III protocol. It combines multiple components into a tabbed interface, allowing users to view their position, supply and borrow assets, view market statistics, and see their transaction history.

## Usage

```jsx
import { CompoundDashboard } from 'compound-react';
import { providers } from 'ethers';

function MyComponent() {
  // Create an Ethereum provider
  const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  
  return (
    <CompoundDashboard 
      provider={provider}
      chainId={1} // Ethereum Mainnet
      userAddress="0x..." // Optional user address
    />
  );
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `provider` | `Provider` | The Ethereum provider to use for transactions and data fetching |
| `chainId` | `number` | The chain ID of the network to connect to |
| `userAddress` | `string` | Optional user address to display data for (defaults to connected wallet) |
| `baseAssetSymbol` | `string` | Optional symbol of the base asset (e.g., "USDC") |
| `baseAssetDecimals` | `number` | Optional decimals of the base asset (e.g., 6 for USDC) |
| `defaultTab` | `string` | Optional default tab to display (default: "overview") |
| `showNetworkSelector` | `boolean` | Whether to show the network selector (default: true) |
| `className` | `string` | Optional CSS class name to apply to the component |
| `onTabChange` | `(tab: string) => void` | Optional callback function called when the active tab changes |

## Example

```jsx
<CompoundDashboard 
  provider={provider}
  chainId={1}
  userAddress="0x..."
  baseAssetSymbol="USDC"
  baseAssetDecimals={6}
  defaultTab="supply-borrow"
  showNetworkSelector={true}
  className="max-w-6xl mx-auto"
  onTabChange={(tab) => console.log(`Active tab: ${tab}`)}
/>
```

## Dashboard Tabs

The dashboard includes the following tabs:

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab displays a summary of the user's position and market statistics:

- **User Position Summary**: Shows the user's supplied assets, borrowed amount, and health factor
- **Interest Rate Display**: Shows current supply and borrow interest rates
- **Market Stats**: Shows key market statistics like total supply, total borrow, and utilization rate

### Supply & Borrow Tab

The Supply & Borrow tab provides forms for supplying and borrowing assets:

- **Supply Form**: Allows users to supply assets to the protocol
- **Withdraw Form**: Allows users to withdraw supplied assets
- **Borrow Form**: Allows users to borrow assets from the protocol
- **Repay Form**: Allows users to repay borrowed assets

### Assets Tab

The Assets tab displays detailed information about all assets in the protocol:

- **Asset List**: Shows all available assets with their prices, supply APY, and borrow APY
- **Asset Details**: Shows detailed information about each asset, including collateral factors and supply caps

### Transaction History Tab

The Transaction History tab displays a chronological list of the user's transactions with the protocol:

- **Transaction List**: Shows all transactions with their type, asset, amount, and date
- **Filtering Options**: Allows filtering transactions by type and asset

## Network Switching

The dashboard includes a network selector that allows users to switch between different networks where Compound III is deployed:

- **Network Selector**: Displays a dropdown of supported networks
- **Automatic Switching**: Automatically switches the connected wallet to the selected network

## Loading and Error States

The component handles loading and error states automatically:

- While data is being fetched, loading indicators are displayed
- If errors occur during data fetching or transactions, error messages are displayed
- If the user is not connected to a wallet, a connect wallet button is displayed

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the dashboard using the `className` prop:

```jsx
<CompoundDashboard 
  provider={provider}
  chainId={1}
  className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md dark:bg-gray-800"
/>
```
