Compound III, also known as Comet, is the latest version of the Compound protocol. This page provides an overview of how Compound III works and its key concepts.

## What is Compound III?

Compound III is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to supply assets as collateral and borrow a single base asset. It's a significant evolution from previous versions of Compound, with a focus on capital efficiency, risk management, and user experience.

## Key Features of Compound III

### Single Borrowable Asset

Unlike previous versions of Compound, Compound III focuses on a single borrowable asset per deployment (e.g., USDC on Ethereum). This design choice allows for:

- Simplified risk management
- Improved capital efficiency
- Better user experience

### Collateral Assets

While there is only one borrowable asset, users can supply multiple types of assets as collateral. Each collateral asset has specific parameters:

- **Collateral Factor**: The percentage of the collateral's value that can be borrowed
- **Liquidation Factor**: The threshold at which a position becomes eligible for liquidation
- **Liquidation Penalty**: The discount given to liquidators when purchasing collateral

### Account Management

Compound III introduces several new account management features:

- **Collateral Assets**: Users can supply multiple assets as collateral
- **Borrowing**: Users can borrow the base asset against their collateral
- **Health Factor**: A measure of the safety of a user's position
- **Liquidation**: The process of repaying a user's debt in exchange for their collateral

## How Compound III Works

### Supplying Collateral

Users can supply assets as collateral to the protocol. These assets are then used to secure borrowing positions.

```jsx
// Example of supplying collateral using Compound React
const { supply } = useSupplyCollateral();
await supply('WETH', '1.0'); // Supply 1.0 WETH as collateral
```

### Borrowing

Users can borrow the base asset against their collateral up to a certain limit determined by the collateral factor.

```jsx
// Example of borrowing using Compound React
const { borrow } = useBorrow();
await borrow('1000'); // Borrow 1000 USDC
```

### Repaying

Users can repay their borrowed amount at any time.

```jsx
// Example of repaying using Compound React
const { repay } = useRepay();
await repay('500'); // Repay 500 USDC
```

### Withdrawing Collateral

Users can withdraw their collateral as long as they maintain a healthy position.

```jsx
// Example of withdrawing collateral using Compound React
const { withdraw } = useWithdrawCollateral();
await withdraw('WETH', '0.5'); // Withdraw 0.5 WETH
```

### Liquidation

If a user's position becomes unhealthy (i.e., their health factor falls below 1), their position can be liquidated by other users.

```jsx
// Example of liquidating a position using Compound React
const { liquidate } = useLiquidate();
await liquidate('0x1234...', 'WETH', '1000'); // Liquidate 1000 USDC of debt, taking WETH as collateral
```

## Interest Rates

Compound III uses a dynamic interest rate model that adjusts based on the utilization of the protocol:

- **Supply APY**: The interest rate earned by suppliers of collateral
- **Borrow APY**: The interest rate paid by borrowers

The interest rates are determined by the utilization rate of the protocol, which is the ratio of borrowed assets to supplied assets.

## Protocol Rewards

Compound III may distribute rewards to users who interact with the protocol. These rewards can be claimed by users and are typically distributed in the form of tokens.

```jsx
// Example of claiming rewards using Compound React
const { claim } = useClaimRewards();
await claim(); // Claim all available rewards
```
