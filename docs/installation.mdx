Getting started with Compound React is straightforward. This guide will walk you through the installation process and basic setup.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Compound React, make sure you have:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A React project (v16.8.0 or later)

## Installing the Package

You can install Compound React using npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install compound-react-kit

# Using yarn
yarn add compound-react-kit
```

## Peer Dependencies

Compound React has the following peer dependencies:

- `react` (>=16.8.0)
- `react-dom` (>=16.8.0)

Make sure these are installed in your project.

## Setting Up the Provider

To use the hooks provided by Compound React, you need to wrap your application with the `CompoundProvider` component:

```jsx
import { CompoundProvider } from 'compound-react';
import { providers } from 'ethers';

function App() {
  // Create an Ethereum provider
  const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  
  return (
    <CompoundProvider provider={provider}>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </CompoundProvider>
  );
}
```

The `CompoundProvider` accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Description | Required |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| `provider` | `Provider` | An ethers.js provider | Yes |
| `network` | `string` | The network to connect to (defaults to the provider's network) | No |
| `market` | `string` | The Compound III market to use (defaults to the main market for the network) | No |

## TypeScript Support

Compound React is built with TypeScript and provides type definitions out of the box. No additional setup is required to use it with TypeScript.
